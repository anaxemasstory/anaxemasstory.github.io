                <p class="lead"><span class="bloody"> An AXEMAS Story </span> is a holiday-themed take on 80s slasher films, set on a Christmas tree farm - and taking place from the perspective of the trees. </p>
              <p class="lead">In an attempt to bond with his grand daughter (Small Paulette), Grandpa (Old Small Paul) invites her to participate in dramatic retelling of a Christmas back in the 1980’s where Trees mysteriously began disappearing.</p>
              <p class="lead">It’s a bloody (“sappy”) send-up of capitalism, Christmas shows, sexist 80’s tropes, and the religious right - but mostly, it's a very silly musical with a lot of tree puns.</p>
